## Generating Content for Each Tab using DOM Manipulation and Webpack

In the Flavors Delight Restaurant project, the website's dynamic content generation is achieved through DOM manipulation and is organized using Webpack, a powerful build tool for modern web applications. This approach allows for seamless content updates without needing to reload the entire page, creating a smoother user experience.

### 1. **DOM Manipulation:**

DOM manipulation is at the core of creating interactive web pages. It involves using JavaScript to interact with and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page. In the project, each tab's content is dynamically generated and replaced within the main content area of the webpage.

```javascript
Home() // Home.js
Menu() // Menu.js
Contact() // Contact.js
```

These functions are responsible for creating the content for the respective tabs. They utilize DOM methods like `createElement`, `textContent`, and `appendChild` to construct the HTML structure and add it to the page.

### 2. **Webpack and Modularization:**

Webpack is used to manage the project's assets, dependencies, and build process. The project is structured in a modular way, with each tab's content residing in separate JavaScript modules. This enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

### 3. **Navigation Interaction:**

The navigation menu is made interactive by attaching event listeners to the navigation buttons. When a button is clicked, it triggers the appropriate content generation function for the selected tab.

```javascript
const homeButton = document.createElement("button");
homeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (!homeButton.classList.contains("active")) {
    setActiveButton(homeButton);
    Home();
  }
});
```

### 4. **Active Button State:**

To provide visual feedback to users about the active tab, a CSS class (`active`) is applied to the active button. This class is toggled on and off based on user interaction.

```javascript
function setActiveButton(button) {
  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll(".button-nav");

  buttons.forEach(btn => {
    if (btn !== button) {
      btn.classList.remove("active");
    }
  });

  button.classList.add("active");
}
```

### 5. **Webpack Build:**

Webpack's configuration handles the bundling of JavaScript modules, CSS, and assets. This ensures that the final output is optimized for performance. The project can be built using the `webpack` command, and the bundled files are generated in the `dist` directory.

### 6. **Webpack Dev Server:**

During development, the Webpack Dev Server allows for hot-reloading, meaning changes are immediately reflected in the browser without the need to manually refresh. This speeds up the development process and improves productivity.

```bash
npm run start
```

In conclusion, the combination of DOM manipulation and Webpack streamlines the process of generating and updating content for each tab on the Flavors Delight Restaurant website. This approach provides an efficient and user-friendly experience for visitors while maintaining clean and organized code.
